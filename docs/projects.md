### Prisoner's dilemma simulator

Using my knowledge of the programming language python, I decided to create a simulation of the famous prisoner's dilemma. Coding this dilemma into python really drives home how despite from a rational and selfish perspective choosing to steal/defect every time is best for you, under repeated runs naturally results in both parties co-operating (unless either party always defects in which case they both always lose). It's really cool how such a simple problem can represent so many real life scenarios such as competing businesses (specifically when advertising to a non-expanding consumer base).
