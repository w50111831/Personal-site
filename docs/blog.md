## Why and How behavioural insights from Thinking, Fast and Slow challenged and continue to challenge established economic theory.

We can perfectly predict how every economic agent will make decisions in the real world.

Sounds ridiculous, right?

Well we still use that basic, reductionist assumption every day in stock market predictions, business decisions and even when thinking about ourselves. Today I'll be writing about how new behavioural insights and common sense challenge oversimplified existing economic theory such as homo economicus, utility theory and rational agent economics. 


In classical economics, economic agents such as Firms, nations and consumers are all rational.

### But what do economists mean by rational?

To answer this seemingly simple question we have to travel back in time. As economics as a science was developing in the mid 1700s by pioneers and philosophers such as Adam Smith and David Hume they had to construct the laws and defiinitions of economics from scratch. As you can imagine coming up with these ideas alone is hard however then writing it down in such a concise and simple way that others could understand was nigh impossible. To do so  they had to heuristically assume some things to simplify it. This involved ignoring the blatant fact that human's are inherently unpredictable or rather only partly predictable and instead assuming that every human wanted what's best only for themselves and that they could account for every possible variable when making a decision, in order to get the most value. Whilst this assumption meant that any economic models produced under this assumption were going to have huge inaccuracies it did let Adam Smith convey how capitalism would result in higher wealth per capita and let him have many fascinating insights such as how to price goods and services and of course create the classic supply and demand diagram.


Expanding on this, economists from the 1800s to 1950s kept refining this rationality model with utility maximisation and other miscellaneous tweaks. This includes the fact that every economic agent seeks to maximise utility when making decisions, that economic agents have overwhelmingly stable preferences for certain items and that they make consistent choices. So assuming nothing changes they will keep choosing the same option.

Now that we've established what rational classical economics is, we can study how many behavioural insights found by Daniel Kahneman not only challenge these assumptions but rather should wholly replace them when greater accuracy is needed.

First I would like to talk about system 1 and system 2. These systems represent the two "modes" your brain can be using at any time. System 1 is a super fast, low effort but unconscious decision making process and system 2 is a slow, high effort but conscious and more rational process. The best way to describe this is (in my opinion) chess, since this requires a lot of active conscious thinking and so you will be using system 2 for almost the whole game. On the contrary deciding where to place your coffee mug on the side of the kitchen in the morning would be something you don't even think about for a millisecond consciously and so is fully decided by system 1. This hugely impacts predicting consumers as whether someone is using system 1 or system 2 for a decision will completely change the parameters under which they will buy or not buy.

Secondly, heuristics are used even by system 2. Heuristics in this case meaning that your brain doesn't have the computing power to account for every single variable when calculating for decisions. Instead it will try to make as accurate a prediction as it can based on only key facts and readily available information. Importantly, many of the variables it does account for aren't actually relevant to the decision as Kahneman discussed. He referenced the famous experiment where judges assigned higher sentences when presented with a higher anchor of 9 months versus a lower anchor of 3 months and the average sentencing difference was a crazy 2 months even though the judge was told that the anchor was random. Note that an anchor is just the number currently at the forefront of your brain - it is theorised that it is used as a baseline for decision making and so the decision the judges came out with started at the irrelevant anchor and then got moved to their final decision - rather than just coming up with a decision.

Finally is prospect theory including interpolated sub theorems such as loss aversion and risk seeking. Prospect theory is the idea that rather than making a decision based on the utility of the outcome - humans instead make decisions based on changes relative to their start point of the decision.From this logic we can derive several key patterns: Loss aversion(losses feel bigger than gains. Losing $1,000 feels worse than winning $1,000), diminishing sensitivity(the difference between $100 and $200 feels way bigger than the difference between $1100 and $1200 even though they are the same change), Risk preferences(People are risk averse when winning money, for example preferring a guaranteed $10 than a 50% chance to get $20 but risk seeking when losing money. For example preferring a 50% chance to lose $20 compared to guaranteed losing $10).

If rational models were accurate one could expect consistent decision making from at the very least investors where they're whole job is based around objectively ranking and investing without emotion however this is not the case. In a study by Hussein A. Hassan Al-Tamimi one of the key findings was that around 63% of investors show emotional biases including one that I've mentioned - loss aversion. If rational models were true and humans were perfectly rational and selfish then behavioural intervention would have no impact on arrests or graduation rates and yet this simply isn't true. In Chicago a program called Becoming a man was launched to help students " learn and practice impulse control, emotional self-regulation, recognition of social cues and interpreting intentions of others, raising aspirations for the future and developing a sense of personal responsibility and integrity." and it was a huge success, it reduced arrests by 32% overall and increased graduation rates by 12-19%. Since this behavioural intervention did show significant real changes to society and people's decision making it's reasonable to deduce that behavioural economics is true to some extent and human's aren't perfectly rational.

### How institutions have already started adopting behavioural economic theory.

A common mistake people make when discussing behavioural economics is assuming that in some way you must either believe in classical economics or behavioural economics however behavioural economics actually slots in perfectly to classical economics. It can extend and refine the decision making process predictions which allows economic models to have more accurate demand curves (since most decisions are choosing what to buy) by using prospect theory instead of utility theory and also by using heuristics in assumptions.

By employing behavioural economic / psychological tricks the UK government auto pension enrolment saw a huge difference in participation rates.

"Occupations within the Public Admin, Education and Health industry, where participation rose by 72 ppts from 14% to 86%. The smallest increase was seen in Professional occupations within the same industry, where participation rose by 20 ppts from 71% to 91%."

### Where behavioural economics still falls short

The biggest shortcoming of behavioural economics still is it's inability to predict human decision making consistently or on a large scale. While it is great at explaining niche scenarios where human's aren't rational it cannot explain whole market movements. I mean a market cannot have loss aversion or be risk seeking, only it's agents can and so it fails to encompass the whole market's average psychology.

### Conclusion

In summary, behavioural economics has the capacity to, and already has fundamentally changed economics as a science. We no longer view humans as perfectly rational in economic theory and this notion now seems absurd. While many economical algorithms still assume humans are rational, with the exponential increase of computing power in recent years and the rise of AI I believe that in the future we will be able to more accurately model human decision making - atleast to the point where assuming humans are perfectly rational becomes deprecated within the next 15 years.
